# Deadwood

**Jesse Ericksen & Karina Sandlin**

This program is adapted from the original Deadwood boardgame made by Cheapass Games
out of Seattle, WA. For instructions on how to play, and more details from the
developers of the board game, see: https://cheapass.com/free-games/deadwood/

How to compile and run: 

*From command line in src folder:*

    > make all
    
    > make run

Note* As of GUI Version, JavaFX Libraries are required to compile and run. 
As these libraries are no longer included in Java 11 they must be imported.

dependencies folder within this gitlab respository.
